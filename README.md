This is  Lab3 MCU, I noted some comments below about my lab:
- Branch Exercise-5: Adding code for button debouncing and increasing mode when first button pressed
- Branch Exercise-6: Adding code for displaying modes and blinking LEDs
- Branch Exercise-7-8-9: Adding code for increasing time duration value for the
red LEDs, amber LEDs and green LEDs
- Branch Exercise-10: Final project.
You should see Exercise-10 because it is the most complete and have some comments in code I added in last.
